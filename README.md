Tinder Autopilot
-------------

##### :rotating_light:Strictly for men! Women use at your own risk!:rotating_light:
##### :rotating_light:Works only on Tinder Web:rotating_light:

A silly JavaScript script that aims to automate the tedious Tinder swiping process by auto-liking almost everything that comes along the way

Features
-----------

Tinder Autopilot tries to mimic human behaviour (a man's one) thus it features
* Auto likes (more frequent)
* Auto dislikes (more rare)
* Will wait until your like limit is over and start swiping again.
* Pause/Resume/Stop buttons

Usage
-------

Just copy/paste the content of [autopilot.js](https://github.com/ThanosFisherman/Tinder-Autopilot/blob/master/autopilot.js) into Chrome's dev console. More specifically:

1. Open Chrome's dev console by typing `Ctrl + Shift + J`
2. Copy the content of [autopilot.js](https://github.com/ThanosFisherman/Tinder-Autopilot/blob/master/autopilot.js)
3. Paste the content with `Ctrl + V` into the Chrome console
4. Press `Enter`
5. Click somewhere inside the Tinder GUI to focus.
6. Enjoy
 
**Alternatively** you can also save this script as a snippet `Ctrl + Shift + J > Sources (tab) > Snippets (subtab)` in Chrome so that you don't have to copy/paste it every time 

Press `Spacebar` at any time to Pause/Resume auto swiping

Press `s` to stop and don't forget to reload the page afterwards.
